# TSP Algorithms
> Project developed for DA 23/24, by Nuno Machado, Rafael Magalh√£es, Ricardo Oliveira.
### Objectives:
Understand the limitations of solving intractable problems like TSP. Implement basic exhaustive approaches and refine critical thinking skills by designing and analyzing approximate solutions using heuristics.

### Problem Statement:
Design efficient algorithms to find optimal routes for vehicles in shipping and delivery scenarios. Backtracking techniques for small graphs and approximation algorithms for larger graphs are emphasized.

### Problem Data and Basic Interface:
Real datasets describe urban delivery points and harbors. Implement a menu-driven interface, functionality to load and parse datasets, and document code using Doxygen.

### Statement of Work:

    Develop a backtracking algorithm for TSP.
    Implement a triangular approximation heuristic.
    Design another heuristic for TSP.
    Develop an algorithm for TSP in real-world graphs.

### The Dataset:
Includes small toy examples, real-world graphs, and extra medium-sized graphs for experimentation.
